## Accessing the settings

<Steps>

  <Step title="Open Project Settings">
    From the editor, go to **Edit → Project Settings**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to the plugin settings">
    In the left sidebar, search for the **Game** category and then select **Dynamic Gameplay Camera**.
  </Step>

</Steps>

You will find all global configuration options for the plugin in this panel.

## Camera Context

The **Camera Context** defines which camera configurations are used for different gameplay situations.

It references multiple **`DGC_CameraData`** Data Assets:

- **IndoorCameraData**
- **OutdoorCameraData**
- **BossFightCameraData**

The assigned context is loaded globally and used by all `DGC_CameraActor` instances.

### Default context

The plugin ships with a ready-to-use camera context:

**`DA_DefaultCameraContext`**

It is located in the plugin content folder and already references preconfigured camera data assets.

By default:

- This context is automatically used
- No configuration is required to get started
- All camera features work out of the box

You may keep using this default context or replace it with your own.

## Creating custom Data Assets

All camera configurations and contexts are **Data Assets** in Unreal Engine. If you are new to them, here’s a quick guide:

- Right-click in the **Content Browser** → **Miscellaneous → Data Asset**
- In the class picker, select the appropriate class:
  - **`DGC_CameraData`** for individual camera configurations
  - **`DGC_CameraContextData`** for context assets combining multiple camera data
- Name your asset and save it in a suitable folder in your project

## Creating a custom camera context

<Steps>

  <Step title="Create camera configuration assets">
    Create one or more **`DGC_CameraData`** assets.

    Each asset defines a complete camera profile, including positioning, movement interpolation, rotation limits, collision behavior, FOV ranges, targeting parameters, and refocus settings.

    Example naming:
    - `DA_IndoorCamera`
    - `DA_OutdoorCamera`
    - `DA_BossFightCamera`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a camera context asset">
    Create a Data Asset based on **`DGC_CameraContextData`**.

    Assign the corresponding camera data assets to:

    - **IndoorCameraData**
    - **OutdoorCameraData**
    - **BossFightCameraData**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign the context in Project Settings">
    In **Project Settings → Game → Dynamic Gameplay Camera**, set your `DGC_CameraContextData` asset in:

    **Configuration | Context → Camera Context**
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Debug Settings

The plugin includes built-in debugging features to help monitor and troubleshoot camera behavior during development.

Available options:

- **Enable Debug** – Master switch for all debug features.
- **Enable Logging** – Outputs camera-related logs to help track state changes and context usage.
- **Draw Debug Shapes** – Displays visual helpers in the world (collision probes, distances, etc...).

These tools are intended for development and should be disabled in production builds.
