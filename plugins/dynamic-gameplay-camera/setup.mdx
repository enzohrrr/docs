    <Step title="Create the camera Actor">
        In the **Content Drawer**, right-click and select **Blueprint Class**, then use the search bar to find and select `DGC_CameraActor` as the parent class.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Spawn the camera">
        Open your **Player Character** and add the following logic.
        In the **Spawn Actor** node, assign your previously created `DGC_CameraActor` Blueprint, then promote the spawned camera reference to a variable for later use.

        You can call it for exemple: **CameraActor**

    <Step title="Add camera inputs">
        Instead of using `Add Yaw Input` and `Add Pitch Input` directly on the character (as done in the default Third Person template), forward the rotation input to your `DGC_CameraActor`.

        Use the stored camera reference and apply the yaw and pitch values on the camera instance itself.

        Since the camera actor may not be initialized yet, or could be spawned or destroyed dynamically during gameplay, always protect this logic with an **Is Valid** check to avoid runtime errors and invalid references.

    </Step>

        <Step title="Bind the targeting input">
        The plugin exposes two functions on the `DGC_CameraActor`: **Start Targeting** and **Stop Targeting**.

        Using your camera actor reference, simply call these functions when your targeting input action is triggered.

        In this example (inspired by *Devil May Cry*–style targeting), **Start Targeting** is called on **Triggered**, while **Stop Targeting** is called on both **Canceled** and **Completed**.
        This means the player must hold the button to stay in targeting mode, and targeting stops immediately when the button is released.

        This approach also allows the system to automatically switch targets if the current one becomes invalid (for example, if it is destroyed or despawned).

    </Step>

    <Step title="Enable targeting on enemies">
        To allow the camera system to target an actor, the `DGC_TargetingInterface` must be implemented on its class.

        It is recommended to add this interface to the base class of all your enemies, or to any parent class of actors that you want to be targetable.

        To do this, open the actor Blueprint, go to **Class Settings**, then in the **Interfaces** category, click **Add** next to **Implemented Interfaces** and select `DGC_TargetingInterface`.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Add a targeting widget component">
      To display visual feedback when an actor is targeted, add a **Widget** component to the actor that can be targeted.
    
      Open the actor Blueprint, click **Add Component**, and select **Widget**.  
      You can name it for example `TargetingWidget`.

      <Frame>
        <img src="/assets/images/dynamic-gameplay-camera/add-widget.png"/>
      </Frame>
    
      This widget will be used to display UI elements when the actor is targeted, such as a simple lock-on marker (like in *Souls* games) or a health bar (as seen in *Devil May Cry*).
      
    </Step>

    <Step title="Provide the targeting widget to the camera system">
      Thanks to the interface added in the previous step, a new function is now available in the actor Blueprint.
    
      You can find it in the **My Blueprint** panel under **Interfaces**.  
  A new category **Dynamic Gameplay Camera → Targeting Interface** should appear, containing the function `GetTargetingWidgetComponent`.
  
      <Frame>
        <img src="/assets/images/dynamic-gameplay-camera/interface-panel.png"/>
      </Frame>
    
      This function simply needs to return a reference to the **Widget** component you created earlier (for example: `TargetingWidget`).
  
      <Frame>
        <img src="/assets/images/dynamic-gameplay-camera/interface-function.png"/>
      </Frame>
    
      This allows the camera system to know which widget to display when the actor is targeted.
    </Step>
