## Avoid unnecessary camera collisions

Many third-person games suffer from unstable and frustrating cameras in tight environments.
One very common cause is **blocking the camera on too many environment meshes**.

By default, Unreal Engine meshes often block the `Camera` collision channel. This is especially noticeable in many Unreal-based souls-like games, where dense levels and narrow spaces cause the camera to constantly collide with small props and decorative geometry.

The result is frequent camera jumps, forced zoom-ins, and poor visibility during gameplay.

### Recommended approach

- Disable camera collision on meshes that do not strictly need it
  (`Collision → Camera → Ignore`)
- Keep camera blocking only for large structural elements (terrain, major walls, buildings)
- Use **camera-fade materials** on obstructing objects instead of physical camera blocking (as described in this documentation)

This simple setup greatly improves camera stability and overall player experience, especially in confined spaces.

## Use a low near clip plane

A high near clip plane value can cause unexpected visual clipping when the camera gets close to objects, especially if those objects do not use a camera-fade material.

To avoid this:

- Go to **Project Settings**
- Search for **Near Clip Plane**
  (or navigate to **Engine → General Settings**)
- Set the value to a low number, such as `1` (default is `10`)

<Warning>
After changing the near clip plane value, you must **restart Unreal Engine** for the change to take effect.
</Warning>

This small adjustment helps prevent distracting visual artifacts and improves overall camera consistency.
