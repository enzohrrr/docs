Dynamic Gameplay Camera is an Unreal Engine plugin designed to provide a flexible and production-ready gameplay camera system, with built-in support for context switching (indoor / outdoor / boss fights) and advanced targeting mechanics inspired by modern action games.

It allows developers to quickly integrate a robust third-person camera workflow, fully data-driven and customizable via DataAssets.
